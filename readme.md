#leaflet-markers-within-radius
[Live demo](http://csessig86.github.io/leaflet-markers-within-radius/)

This demo shows how to calculate how many points are within a radius using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). It uses [jquery-geocodify](http://jquery-geocodify.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), which creates a form that allows readers to enter their address and have it plotted on the map.

To use, enter an address and then enter a radius. Under results will be the number of markers within the given radius. You can also drag the marker on the map; the number will update automatically.
